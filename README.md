<h3 align="center">How REALTORS&reg; Connect</h3>

One of the benefits REALTORÂ® associations offer to their members is being added to a Listserv. A Listserve is basically an email list where you can subscribe to receive emails from those who send to it. This leads to a lot of unnecessary emails. REAL Exchange aims to reduce the inbox noise and create a place where REALTOR members can post their messages and quickly add other members as contacts.
